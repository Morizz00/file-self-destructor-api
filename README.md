📦 Self-Destructing File Share API

A minimal Go API for uploading files that delete themselves — after a single download or 5 minutes.
Perfect for sharing secrets, cursed contracts, or sensitive memes.

🚀 Features

🔥 Upload files via REST

💥 Auto-deletes after the number of  downloads you set or 5 minutes, whichever comes first

⚡ Powered by Redis for in-memory speed and TTL-based cleanup

📬 Also returns a one-time-use download link

✅ File uploaded!
Download link: /file/4a2f9d (valid for 5 mins or 1 download)


---

GET /file/:id

Deletes it immediately after the number of downloads is reached


curl http://localhost:8080/file/4a2f9d --output recovered.txt

If expired or already downloaded:

404 Not Found

🔐 Security Notes

This is designed for short-term, secure transfers

Once a file is downloaded, it's gone forever

Don’t use this for long-term storage or tax returns (unless you like chaos)
